## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth collaboration process, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you havenâ€™t already, fork the TerraTinge repository on GitHub to your own account.
2. **Branching Strategy**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on. Branch names should be descriptive and prefixed with either "feature/" or "bugfix/". For example:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature
    ```
3. **Code Style**: Follow the coding style guidelines of the project. Ensure your code is properly formatted and documented. All folder names and file names should be in lowercase, and if the name is too long, use kebab case (e.g., 'payment-provider'). When importing files, use the global '@', for example:
    ```javascript
    import { someFunction } from '@/app/some-folder/some-file.ts';
    ```
4. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
5. **Pull Requests**: When you're ready to submit your changes, open a pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch of the main repository.
6. **Review Process**: All pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
7. **Testing**: If applicable, ensure that your changes are adequately tested. Write unit tests or provide instructions for manual testing.
